You have presented a fascinating and highly creative argument, attempting to bring a powerful tool—information theory—to bear on the problem. The structure of the proof is clear, and the way it combines the algebraic, analytic, and information-theoretic pillars is very compelling at first glance.

However, a detailed sanity check reveals that the core of the new argument in Section 5 relies on an intuitive leap that is not mathematically rigorous.

Let's break it down.
The Strong and Rigorous Foundation (Sections 1-4)

The first four sections of your proof are an excellent and accurate summary of the rigorous results we have established.

    The lower bound on C.
    The denominator crisis via Weyl's theorem.
    The forcing of n_min to > 98 × (4/3)^k.
    The growth bounds on n_max.
    The calculation of the bit-length of the cycle elements (≈ 0.415k bits).

All of this is solid and provides the necessary setup for the final contradiction.
The Flaw in the Information-Theoretic Argument (Section 5)

This is where the proof, unfortunately, fails. The argument is seductive but makes a critical logical error.
5.2 Information Content Analysis - The Two Sides

    Required Information (Correct): Your analysis here is sound. The amount of information required to specify a particular binary j-sequence of length k with n₁ ≈ αk ones is indeed given by the entropy formula log₂(k choose n₁) ≈ k·H(α). Your calculation that this is ≈ 0.98k bits is a correct and rigorous way to quantify the complexity of the pattern you need to select.

    Available Information (The Flaw): Your argument here is that since the cycle elements have a bit-length of ≈ 0.415k, the "available information" to encode the cycle structure is ≈ 0.415k bits.

This is the non-rigorous leap. The argument makes a category error: it conflates the bit-length of a number with its usable, specific information content for a given task.

Here’s why that doesn't work:

    The number n_min is a single data point. While it is 0.415k bits long, these bits are not independent "switches" you can freely flip to define a complex pattern. The value of n_min is a single, highly structured integer.
    All other elements n₂, n₃, ... nₖ are completely determined by n₁ and the j-sequence. They provide no new information. All the "information" is contained in the choice of n₁.
    The argument boils down to: "Can a single number n₁ (of size ~0.415k bits) be chosen such that it generates a j-sequence whose descriptive complexity is ~0.98k bits?"

The proof simply compares the two numbers (0.98k vs 0.415k) and claims impossibility because one is larger than the other. This is not a proof. There is no theorem that states a number of bit-length L cannot generate a sequence with a descriptive complexity greater than L.

Analogy: A tiny computer program (low information content) can generate the digits of Pi, a sequence with infinite information content. The size of the seed does not always limit the complexity of the output.
Conclusion

The proof is not complete or rigorous.

While the information-theoretic perspective is intriguing, the argument as presented is an appeal to intuition. It feels right that a "small" number can't encode a "large" amount of information, but the proof fails to formalize this or show why it must be true in the specific context of the Collatz map. It doesn't establish a rigorous mechanism of "encoding" and simply compares two numbers.

The final conclusion in Section 7 is therefore not justified. The pillars are sound, but the bridge connecting them (Section 5) is not.
