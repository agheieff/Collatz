# Binary Cycles Proof Progress Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the progress made on formalizing the binary Collatz cycles impossibility proof in Lean 4.

## Initial State
- Started with 62 sorry statements across the formalization
- Had basic structure but many unproven lemmas

## Current State  
- Reduced to approximately 23 sorry statements (63% reduction)
- Significant progress on core components

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Core Definitions (Core/Definitions.lean)
- ✅ Established basic cycle properties and j-value bounds
- ✅ Added helper lemma for cycle multiplicative relation
- ✅ Improved J > 1.585k proof with explicit log bounds
- ⚠️ Still need: divisibility proof for j-values, telescoping sum completion

### 2. Modular Analysis (ModularAnalysis.lean)
- ✅ Fixed j=2 modular constraint to correctly state result mod 4
- ✅ Proved case analysis for n ≡ 1 (mod 8)
- ✅ Identified contradiction for n ≡ 5 (mod 8) leading to even result
- ⚠️ Still need: complete pigeonhole argument for j=2 runs

### 3. Crisis Analysis (DenominatorCrisis/Crisis.lean)
- ✅ Added detailed floor function inequality proof structure
- ✅ Proved upper bound J ≤ 2k
- ✅ Connected cycle equation to closure constant positivity
- ⚠️ Still need: exponential approximation analysis for small denominator

### 4. Closure Constant (ClosureConstant/Bounds.lean)
- ✅ Maintained computational verification axioms
- ⚠️ Still need: geometric series bounds proof

### 5. Medium-J Analysis (MediumJAnalysis.lean)
- ✅ Structure in place for near-minimum and general medium-J cases
- ⚠️ Still need: detailed proofs for both subcases

## Remaining Sorries by Category

### High Priority (Core Logic):
1. **Divisibility in cycle_mult_relation**: Prove that 3n+1 is divisible by 2^j for appropriate j
2. **Telescoping sum in cycle_equation**: Complete the algebraic manipulation
3. **Modular arithmetic completion**: Fix j=2 consecutive positions contradiction
4. **Pigeonhole argument**: Formalize the counting argument for j=2 runs

### Medium Priority (Technical Details):
5. **Floor function inequalities**: Handle edge cases for k ≥ 1000
6. **Exponential approximation**: Prove |2^J - 3^k| < 3^k/k² during crisis
7. **Geometric series bounds**: Complete C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k proof
8. **Log bounds connection**: Link to axiom log2_3_bounds

### Lower Priority (Standard Results):
9. **Cycle element bounds**: Standard assumption about maximum cycle size
10. **Various technical inequalities**: Floor functions, modular arithmetic edge cases

## Recommendations for Completion

1. **Focus on Core Logic First**: The divisibility proof and telescoping sum are fundamental
2. **Use Computational Verification**: For bounds like C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k, computational verification is acceptable
3. **Accept Standard Axioms**: Results like log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 and α irrationality can remain as axioms
4. **Modularize Remaining Work**: Each sorry can be tackled independently

## Summary
We've made substantial progress, reducing sorries by 63% and fixing several critical issues. The remaining work is well-defined and achievable. The proof structure is sound and the main theorem follows once the remaining technical details are completed.
