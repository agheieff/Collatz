/-- Key modular fact: For j=2, odd result requires n ≡ 1 (mod 8) -/
lemma j2_mod_constraint (n : ℕ) (hn : Odd n) :
  Odd (T n 2) ↔ n % 8 = 1 := by
  constructor
  · intro h_odd
    -- T n 2 = (3n+1)/4 is odd means 3n+1 ≡ 4 (mod 8)
    -- So 3n ≡ 3 (mod 8)
    -- Since 3 is coprime to 8, we can solve: n ≡ 1 (mod 8)
    sorry
  · intro h_mod
    -- If n ≡ 1 (mod 8), then n = 8k + 1
    -- So 3n + 1 = 24k + 4 = 4(6k + 1)
    -- Thus (3n+1)/4 = 6k + 1, which is odd
    sorry

/-- For j=1 with n ≡ 3 (mod 8), result is ≡ 5 (mod 8) -/
lemma j1_from_3mod8 (n : ℕ) (hn : n % 8 = 3) :
  T n 1 % 8 = 5 := by
  -- n = 8k + 3, so 3n + 1 = 24k + 10 = 2(12k + 5)
  -- T n 1 = 12k + 5 ≡ 5 (mod 8)
  sorry

/-- Cannot continue from 5 (mod 8) -/
lemma cannot_continue_5mod8 (n : ℕ) (hn : n % 8 = 5) :
  ¬Odd (T n 1) ∧ ¬Odd (T n 2) := by
  constructor
  · -- For j=1: n = 8k+5, so 3n+1 = 24k+16 = 16(something)

    sorry

/-- High-J cycle structure -/

  -- Cycle property
  is_cycle : ∀ i, n (i + 1) = T (n i) (j i).val.succ
  -- High-J condition: at least 90% have j=2
  high_j : (Finset.filter (·.snd = 1) (Finset.univ.attach.map 
    ⟨fun i => (i.val, j i.val), by sorry⟩)).card ≥ 9 * k / 10

/-- In high-J cycles, j=2 positions need n ≡ 1 (mod 8) -/
lemma high_j_mod_pattern (k : ℕ) (c : HighJCycle k) :
  ∀ i, c.j i = 1 → c.n i % 8 = 1 := by
  intro i hi
  -- Since j i = 2 and the next element is odd
  have : Odd (c.n (i + 1)) := c.all_odd (i + 1)
  rw [c.is_cycle i, hi] at this
  exact (j2_mod_constraint (c.n i) (c.all_odd i)).mp this

/-- The cycle closure equation forces j=1 positions to have n ≡ 3 (mod 8) -/
lemma closure_forces_3mod8 (k : ℕ) (c : HighJCycle k) (hk : k > 100) :
  ∀ i, c.j i = 0 → c.n i % 8 = 3 := by
  -- This follows from analyzing the 2-adic valuations in the cycle equation
  -- All j=2 positions contribute 2-adic valuation 2
  -- For the total to match, j=1 positions must contribute valuation 1
  -- This happens exactly when n ≡ 3 (mod 8)
  sorry

/-- Main theorem: High-J cycles are impossible -/
theorem high_j_impossible (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 100) :
  ¬∃ c : HighJCycle k, True := by
  intro ⟨c⟩
  -- Find a j=1 position (must exist since not all can be j=2)
  have : ∃ i, c.j i = 0 := by
    -- If all were j=2, then sum would be 2k, but we need sum < 2k
    sorry
  obtain ⟨i, hi⟩ := this
  
  -- By closure_forces_3mod8, we have n i ≡ 3 (mod 8)
  have h3 : c.n i % 8 = 3 := closure_forces_3mod8 k c hk i hi
  
  -- So T(n i, 1) ≡ 5 (mod 8)
  have h5 : T (c.n i) 1 % 8 = 5 := j1_from_3mod8 (c.n i) h3
  
  -- But then we cannot continue the cycle
  have : ¬Odd (T (T (c.n i) 1) 1) ∧ ¬Odd (T (T (c.n i) 1) 2) := 
    cannot_continue_5mod8 (T (c.n i) 1) h5
  
  -- This contradicts the cycle property

  rw [this] at h5
  
  -- The next step must be odd, but cannot be
  have : Odd (c.n ((i + 1) + 1)) := c.all_odd ((i + 1) + 1)
