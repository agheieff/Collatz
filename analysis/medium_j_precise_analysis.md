# Precise Medium-J Analysis: Combining Lean Structure with Mathematical Computation

## The Setup (from Lean formalization)

For a k-cycle with medium-J (1.6k ≤ J < 1.9k), we need to analyze:
```
n₁ = C/|d| where d = 2^J - 3^k
```

## Step 1: Denominator Analysis

For J = k(1.585 + ε) where 0.015 ≤ ε < 0.315:

```
d = 2^{k(1.585+ε)} - 3^k
  = 3^k(2^{k(1.585+ε)}/3^k - 1)
  = 3^k(2^{k(1.585+ε-log₂3)} - 1)
  = 3^k(2^{kε} - 1)  [since 1.585 ≈ log₂3]
```

For small ε: 2^{kε} - 1 ≈ kε × ln(2) ≈ 0.693kε

So: d ≈ 3^k × 0.693kε

## Step 2: The Critical Ratio

```
n₁ = C/d ≥ (0.686 × 4^k)/(3^k × 0.693kε)
   = 0.686/(0.693ε) × (4/3)^k/k
   ≈ 0.99/ε × (4/3)^k/k
```

## Step 3: The Growth Analysis

We need n₁ ≤ 2^k, which requires:
```
0.99/ε × (4/3)^k/k ≤ 2^k
```

Equivalently:
```
(4/3)^k/2^k ≤ ε × k/0.99
(2/3)^k ≤ ε × k/0.99
```

Taking logarithms:
```
k × log(2/3) ≤ log(ε × k/0.99)
-0.405k ≤ log(ε) + log(k) + 0.01
```

## Step 4: The Contradiction

For k = 2000 and ε = 0.1:
- LHS: -0.405 × 2000 = -810
- RHS: log(0.1) + log(2000) + 0.01 ≈ -2.3 + 7.6 + 0.01 ≈ 5.31

We need -810 ≤ 5.31, which is true!

Wait, this means the inequality IS satisfied. Let me recalculate...

## Step 5: Correcting the Analysis

Actually, I made an error. Let's be more careful:

For medium-J with J = k × 1.7 (taking ε ≈ 0.115):
```
d = 2^{1.7k} - 3^k
```

This is NOT small when k is large! Let me reconsider...

## Step 6: The Real Issue with Medium-J

The problem with medium-J isn't that the denominator is tiny (that's crisis). 
Instead, it's the combination of:
1. Structural constraints on j-sequences
2. Growth patterns of elements
3. Modular restrictions

Let me write code to explore this...
