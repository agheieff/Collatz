====== SUMMARY FOR CYCLE IMPOSSIBILITY ======
Key questions this data addresses:
1. Do large tail₂ values create forced j=2 runs? [Check Test Group 1]
2. Do huge numbers achieve ~41.5% j=1 needed for cycles? [Check Test Groups 2,4]
3. Are j=2 runs too long when numbers are large? [Check Test Group 5]
4. Do simulated cycle elements show special patterns? [Check Test Group 3]
