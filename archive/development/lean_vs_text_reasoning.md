# Lean-First vs Text-First Mathematical Reasoning: A Comparison

## The Two Approaches

### 1. Lean-First Approach
Start with formal definitions and proofs in Lean, then explain in text.

**Advantages:**
- Forces extreme precision from the start
- Catches logical gaps immediately
- Type system prevents category errors
- Can leverage Lean's tactics for proof discovery
- Computational verification is built-in

**Disadvantages:**
- Syntax overhead can obscure intuition
- Harder to explore "fuzzy" ideas
- May get stuck on technical details
- Less accessible to readers

### 2. Text-First Approach (What we did)
Develop intuition and proofs in natural language, then formalize.

**Advantages:**
- Natural flow of mathematical thinking
- Easy to communicate high-level ideas
- Can sketch proofs before filling details
- More flexible for exploration
- Better for building intuition

**Disadvantages:**
- Can harbor hidden logical flaws
- Easy to handwave over difficulties
- May use imprecise definitions
- Requires separate formalization step

## Specific to the Binary Collatz Problem

Looking at our proof development:

1. **Discovery Phase**: Text was better
   - Found denominator crisis phenomenon
   - Identified modular patterns
   - Developed closure constant bounds
   - Could quickly test ideas with C code

2. **Precision Phase**: Lean would have helped
   - The Borel-Cantelli error wouldn't have happened
   - The information-theoretic argument would have failed type-checking
   - Would have forced us to be precise about what "probability" means

3. **Integration Phase**: Both needed
   - Text for explaining why approaches work
   - Lean for verifying they actually do

## My Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

For complex mathematical problems, I'd suggest:

```
1. Initial exploration in text + code
   ↓
2. Key definitions in Lean
   ↓
3. Proof sketches in text
   ↓
4. Formal statements in Lean
   ↓
5. Fill proof details (both text and Lean)
   ↓
6. Computational verification
```
