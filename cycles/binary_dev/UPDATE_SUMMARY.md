# Binary Collatz Proof Update Summary

## Critical Updates Completed

### 1. Fixed C Growth Understanding
- **Old (WRONG)**: C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k for all k
- **New (CORRECT)**: C ~ 3^k with C/4^k decreasing exponentially
- Created `CGrowthProof.lean` with correct analysis
- Updated all dependent proofs

### 2. Corrected Medium-J Analysis
- Created `MediumJCorrected.lean` using C/4^k decay
- Shows elements become too small for large k
- Works for k ≥ 500 (gap remains for 100 < k < 500)

### 3. Corrected Crisis Analysis  
- Created `CrisisCorrected.lean` using C ~ 3^k growth
- Shows n₁ > c₁ × 3^k / k in crisis, which becomes huge
- Cleaner contradiction than original approach

### 4. Unified Main Theorem
- Created `MainTheoremCorrected.lean` incorporating all corrections
- Clear case structure: small k, high-J, crisis, medium-J
- Identified remaining gap: k ∈ (100, 500)

### 5. Removed Redundant Axiom
- Deleted `cycle_equation_axiom` (already proven)
- Updated imports to use actual proof
- Classified remaining axioms properly

## Key Mathematical Insights

1. **C Formula Structure**: C = Σᵢ 3^(k-i-1) × 2^(Jᵢ) where Jᵢ = j₀ + ... + jᵢ

2. **Why C ~ 3^k**: When J ≈ 1.585k (cycle-compatible), we have Jᵢ ≈ 1.585(i+1), 
   so 2^(Jᵢ) ≈ 3^(i+1), making each term ≈ 3^k

3. **C/4^k Decay**: Since C ~ 3^k, we have C/4^k ~ (3/4)^k which decays exponentially

4. **Impact on Proof**:
   - High-J case: Unchanged (modular contradiction still works)
   - Crisis: Simpler (n₁ > 3^k/k becomes astronomical)
   - Medium-J: Different mechanism (elements too small, not too large)

## Remaining Work

### Critical Gaps (~20-30 sorry statements in new files)
1. Geometric series calculations
2. Numerical verifications (e.g., (3/4)^8 ≈ 0.1)
3. Denominator bounds from Diophantine approximation
4. Gap for k ∈ (100, 500)

### Original 170 Sorry Statements
- Many in old files using wrong C bounds
- Should be deprecated in favor of corrected versions
- Focus on new files: CGrowthProof, MediumJCorrected, CrisisCorrected

## File Organization Recommendation

### Keep (Core Files)
- `Core/Definitions.lean`
- `Core/CycleEquationClean.lean` 
- `CGrowthProof.lean` (NEW)
- `MediumJCorrected.lean` (NEW)
- `CrisisCorrected.lean` (NEW)
- `MainTheoremCorrected.lean` (NEW)
- `ModularAnalysis.lean` (high-J, still valid)
- `SmallKVerification.lean`

### Deprecate (Using Wrong C Bounds)
- `MediumJAnalysis.lean`
- `MediumJComplete.lean` 
- `CrisisAnalysis.lean`
- `CorrectBounds.lean` (partially wrong)
- Multiple versions of FinalTheorem

## Time Estimate
- Filling critical gaps in new files: 1 week
- Computational verification k ∈ (100, 500): 3-4 days
- Cleanup and documentation: 2-3 days
- **Total: ~2 weeks** (more realistic than previous estimates)
