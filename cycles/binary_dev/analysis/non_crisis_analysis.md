# Analysis of Non-Crisis k Values

## The Setting

For k values where {αk} is not very small (say {αk} ≥ 1/k), we don't have the extreme denominator crisis that gives us an immediate contradiction. We need a different approach.

## Key Constraints for Any k-Cycle

### 1. The J-sum Constraint
From the closure constant analysis:
```
1.585k < J ≤ 2k
```

This means the average j-value must be between 1.585 and 2.

### 2. The n₁ Bound
For any k-cycle:
```
n₁ = C/|2^J - 3^k|
```

where C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k.

### 3. The Maximum Element Constraint
The maximum element in the cycle satisfies:
```
n_max ≤ 2^k
```

## Analysis for Non-Crisis k

### Case 1: J Close to Lower Bound (J ≈ 1.585k)

When J is near its minimum:
- We have approximately 0.585k positions with j=2 and 0.415k positions with j=1
- The denominator d = 2^J - 3^k is relatively small (though not crisis-level)
- This forces n₁ to be large

**Key observation**: Even without a crisis, when J ≈ 1.585k:
```
d = 2^{1.585k} - 3^k ≈ 3^k(2^{0.585k/log₂3} - 1) ≈ 3^k × 0.5
```

So:
```
n₁ ≈ (0.686 × 4^k)/(0.5 × 3^k) = 1.372 × (4/3)^k
```

### Case 2: J Close to Upper Bound (J ≈ 2k)

When J is near its maximum:
- Almost all positions have j=2
- The denominator d = 2^{2k} - 3^k = 4^k - 3^k is large
- This allows smaller n₁

However, having mostly j=2 creates a different problem...

## The Parity Constraint

### The Hidden Contradiction

When j=2, we have:
```
n_{i+1} = (3n_i + 1)/4
```

For this to yield an odd number, we need:
```
3n_i + 1 ≡ 4 (mod 8)
```

This means:
```
3n_i ≡ 3 (mod 8)
n_i ≡ 1 (mod 8)
```

**Key insight**: If too many consecutive positions have j=2, we create impossible parity constraints.

### Quantifying the Constraint

For a sequence of m consecutive j=2 values:
- n_i ≡ 1 (mod 8)
- n_{i+1} ≡ 1 (mod 8) 
- ... continuing...

But also:
```
n_{i+m} = (3^m n_i + (3^{m-1} + 3^{m-2} + ... + 1))/4^m
```

The numerator's parity depends on m and creates contradictions for certain patterns.

## The Path Forward

To complete the proof for non-crisis k:

1. **Parity Analysis**: Show that having J close to 2k creates unsolvable modular constraints
2. **Intermediate J**: For J in the middle range, combine:
   - Moderate denominator constraints
   - Parity restrictions
   - Growth bounds on intermediate elements

3. **Density Argument**: Show that the valid (J, n₁) pairs become increasingly sparse

## Conclusion

While non-crisis k values don't have the immediate contradiction of crisis values, they face a combination of constraints:
- Parity restrictions from high j values
- Growth constraints from denominator bounds
- Modular incompatibilities

The challenge is formalizing these into a rigorous impossibility proof.
