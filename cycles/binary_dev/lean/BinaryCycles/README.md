# Binary Collatz Cycles - Lean Formalization

This directory contains the Lean 4 formalization of the binary Collatz cycles impossibility proof.

## Status: INCOMPLETE

The proof is incomplete due to a fundamental error in the original approach. The claim that C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k is FALSE for k ≥ 8. The correct growth is C ~ 3^k, which invalidates the medium-J analysis.

### What Works
- ✓ Small k (≤ 500): Computationally verified  
- ✓ High-J cycles: Modular contradiction proven
- ✓ Crisis cycles: Denominator analysis proven
- ✓ Fundamental equations: Cycle equation, J-sum bounds

### What's Broken
- ✗ Medium-J non-crisis cycles: Need new approach
- ✗ Original C/4^k decay argument: Invalid with C ~ 3^k

## Key Theorems

### The Main Result (with gap)
```lean
theorem no_binary_collatz_cycles : 
    ∀ k : ℕ, ¬∃ cycle : BinaryCycle k, True
```

Status: Proven except for medium-J non-crisis case.

### Complete Sub-results
```lean
-- Small k verified
theorem no_small_k_cycles (k : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k ∧ k ≤ 500)

-- High-J impossible  
theorem high_j_modular_contradiction (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 1000)

-- Crisis impossible
theorem crisis_contradiction (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 100)
```

### The Gap
```lean
-- INCOMPLETE: Need new approach
theorem medium_j_new_approach_needed (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 500)
```

## Mathematical Innovation Needed

The medium-J non-crisis case requires new mathematics:
1. **Problem**: With C ~ 3^k and denominator ~ δ·3^k, we get n₁ ~ constant
2. **Failed approach**: Can't use counting argument when elements don't grow
3. **Needed**: New structural constraints or contradiction mechanism

Possible directions:
- j-pattern forbidden configurations
- Element ratio constraints through cycle
- Different modular analysis
- Cycle closure impossibility from structure
