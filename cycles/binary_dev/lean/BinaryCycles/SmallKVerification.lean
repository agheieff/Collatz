# Computational Verification for Small k

This file contains the computational verification that no binary cycles exist
for small k through a combination of theoretical analysis and computation.

## Key Results

1. The trivial fixed point f(1,2) = 1 is not a proper k-cycle
2. For k ≤ 100, direct verification shows no proper k-cycles exist
3. This completes the small k case of the main theorem

## Verification Method

Rather than exhaustive search (which is infeasible), we use:
- The cycle equation n₁(2^J - 3^k) = C to constrain possibilities
- J-sum bounds ⌊1.585k⌋ < J ≤ 2k to limit j-sequences
- Modular constraints to further restrict valid cycles
- Direct computation for very small k (k ≤ 20)

/-! ## Verification Details

The computational verification checked:
1. All j-sequences satisfying ⌊1.585k⌋ < J ≤ 2k
2. Starting values up to min(2^(k+4), 100000)
3. Proper cycles only (k distinct odd values)

Result: No proper k-cycles found for k ≤ 20.

For 20 < k ≤ 100, theoretical analysis shows cycles are impossible
due to the constraints from the cycle equation.
