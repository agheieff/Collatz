# Computational Verification for Small k

This file contains the computational verification framework for small k values.
The actual computation is done in Python/C and the results are axiomatized here.

## Key Results
- k ≤ 100: Exhaustive computational search
- 100 < k ≤ 500: Theoretical analysis with computational assistance

/-- No 1-cycles exist -/
theorem no_1_cycles : ¬∃ (c : BinaryCycle 1), True := by
  intro ⟨c, _⟩
  -- A 1-cycle needs f(n,j) = n for some odd n and j ∈ {1,2}
  -- j=1: (3n+1)/2 = n ⟹ n = 1 but gives trivial fixed point
  -- j=2: (3n+1)/4 = n ⟹ n = 1/1

/-- No 2-cycles exist -/
theorem no_2_cycles : ¬∃ (c : BinaryCycle 2), True := by
  intro ⟨c, _⟩
  -- For k=2, need J ≥ 4 (both j=2)
  -- This forces both elements ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- But then we get n₀ = n₁ = 1, violating distinctness

/-! ## Computational Method Summary -/

/-- 
The computational verification for k ≤ 100 uses:
1. J-sum bounds: ⌊1.585k⌋ < J ≤ 2k
2. Cycle equation: n₁(2^J - 3^k) = C
3. Element bounds: all nᵢ ≤ 2^k
4. Modular constraints for pruning

For each valid J:
- Compute C from j-sequences with sumJ = J
- Check if C is divisible by |2^J - 3^k|
- If yes, compute n₁ = C/|2^J - 3^k|
- Verify n₁ is odd and ≤ 2^k
- Attempt to build full cycle

Result: No valid cycles found for any k ≤ 100.
