# The Decreasing C/4^k Property

This file develops a new approach based on our computational discovery:
For cycle-compatible J values (⌊1.585k⌋ < J ≤ 2k), the ratio C/4^k 
decreases with k.

This suggests a fundamental incompatibility between cycle requirements
and the growth rate of C.

/-- For cycle-compatible J, C grows slower than 4^k -/
theorem C_growth_rate (k : ℕ) (seq : BinaryJSeq k) (hk : k ≥ 8) :
    let J := sumJ k seq
    ⌊1.585 * k⌋ < J → J ≤ 2 * k →
    ∃ f : ℕ → ℝ, (∀ m ≥ 8, f (m + 1) < f m) ∧ 
      (computeC k seq : ℝ) ≤ f k * 4^k := by
  sorry -- This is what we observed computationally

/-- The cycle equation requires n₁ = C/|2^J - 3^k| -/
theorem cycle_element_formula (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k) (hk : 0 < k) :
    let J := sumJ k cycle.jSeq
    let d := |2^J - 3^k|
    (cycle.elements 0 : ℝ) = (computeC k cycle.jSeq : ℝ) / d := by
  -- From the cycle equation
  have h_eq := cycle_equation k cycle hk
  -- Rearrange to get n₁
  sorry

/-- Key insight: As k grows, cycle requirements become impossible -/
theorem large_k_contradiction (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k) 
    (hk : k > 100) (h_not_high : sumJ k cycle.jSeq < 2 * k - k / 10) :
    False := by
  -- Step 1: Get J bounds
  have hJ := j_sum_bounds k cycle (by omega : 0 < k)
  let J := sumJ k cycle.jSeq
  
  -- Step 2: Since C/4^k decreases, for large k we have
  -- C < ε(k) × 4^k where ε(k) → 0 as k → ∞
  
  -- Step 3: The denominator |2^J - 3^k| has a lower bound
  -- except during crisis (which is rare)
  
  -- Step 4: This gives us n₁ < ε(k) × 4^k / |2^J - 3^k|
  
  -- Step 5: For most J values, |2^J - 3^k| ≥ c × 3^k
  -- So n₁ < ε(k) × 4^k / (c × 3^k) = ε(k)/c × (4/3)^k
  
  -- Step 6: But we also need n₁ to be an odd integer ≥ 1
  -- For large k, ε(k) × (4/3)^k becomes very small
  
  -- Step 7: Eventually, no odd integer can satisfy the constraints
  
  sorry

/-- Alternative: Use the cycle sum identity -/
theorem cycle_sum_approach (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k) (hk : k > 100) :
    let S := Finset.sum Finset.univ (fun i => (cycle.elements i : ℝ))
    S = 4 * (computeC k cycle.jSeq : ℝ) - k := by
  -- This identity gives us another constraint
  sorry

/-- The main insight: C grows too slowly to support large cycles -/
theorem C_growth_incompatible_with_cycles :
    ∃ K : ℕ, ∀ k > K, ¬∃ cycle : BinaryCycle k, 
      sumJ k cycle.jSeq < 2 * k - k / 10 := by
  -- The decreasing C/4^k ratio eventually makes cycles impossible
  -- because n₁ = C/d must be a positive odd integer
  -- but C/d → 0 for large k in most cases
  sorry
