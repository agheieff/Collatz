# Numerical Bounds and Computational Results

This file contains:
1. Bounds on the closure constant C
2. Denominator analysis
3. Growth rate comparisons
4. Numerical lemmas for the proof

## Important Correction
C grows like 3^k, NOT 4^k as originally claimed.

/-! ## C Growth Analysis -/

/-- C grows like 3^k (corrected from false 4^k claim) -/
theorem C_growth_correct (k : ℕ) (seq : BinaryJSeq k) :
    ∃ c₁ c₂ : ℝ, 0 < c₁ ∧ c₁ < c₂ ∧ c₂ < 10 ∧
    c₁ * 3^k ≤ (computeC k seq : ℝ) ∧ (computeC k seq : ℝ) ≤ c₂ * 3^k := by
  -- Constants depend on j-pattern but are bounded
  use 0.5, 2.5
  sorry -- Requires detailed sum analysis

/-- For all j=1 sequence, C = (3^k - 1)/2 -/
theorem C_all_j1 (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 0) :
    let seq : BinaryJSeq k := fun _ => 0  -- All j=1
    computeC k seq = (3^k - 1) / 2 := by
  sorry

/-- For all j=2 sequence, C = 3*(3^k - 1)/2 -/
theorem C_all_j2 (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 0) :
    let seq : BinaryJSeq k := fun _ => 1  -- All j=2  
    computeC k seq = 3 * (3^k - 1) / 2 := by
  sorry

/-- C/4^k ratio decreases with k (but this alone doesn't give contradiction) -/
theorem C_over_4k_decreasing (k : ℕ) (seq : BinaryJSeq k) (hk : k ≥ 8)
    (h_cycle : ⌊1.585 * k⌋ < sumJ k seq ∧ sumJ k seq ≤ 2 * k) :
    (computeC k seq : ℝ) / 4^k < 0.6 := by
  -- Since C ~ 3^k, we have C/4^k ~ (3/4)^k which indeed decreases
  -- But this doesn't lead to the contradiction we need
  sorry

/-! ## Denominator Bounds -/

/-- When J ≈ k·log₂(3), the denominator is small -/
theorem denominator_near_critical (k : ℕ) (J : ℕ) 
    (h_close : |J - k * log 3 / log 2| < 0.01 * k) :
    (|2^J - 3^k| : ℝ) < 3^k / k := by
  sorry

/-- For non-crisis J, denominator is substantial -/
theorem denominator_non_crisis (k : ℕ) (J : ℕ)
    (hJ : ⌊1.585 * k⌋ < J ∧ J < 2 * k)
    (h_far : |J - k * log 3 / log 2| ≥ 0.01 * k) :
    ∃ δ > 0, (|2^J - 3^k| : ℝ) ≥ δ * 3^k := by
  -- When J is far from critical value, denominator is Ω(3^k)
  use 0.001
  sorry

/-! ## Element Bounds -/

/-- From cycle equation, n₁ is determined by C and denominator -/
theorem n1_from_cycle_equation (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k) (hk : 0 < k) :
    let J := sumJ k cycle.jSeq
    (cycle.elements 0 : ℝ) = (computeC k cycle.jSeq : ℝ) / |2^J - 3^k| := by
  have h_eq := cycle_equation k cycle hk
  -- Rearrange to solve for n₁
  sorry

/-- In crisis, n₁ becomes very large -/
theorem n1_large_in_crisis (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k) 
    (hk : k > 100) (h_crisis : isCrisis k) :
    cycle.elements 0 > k^2 := by
  -- C ~ c·3^k and denominator < 3^k/k²
  -- So n₁ = C/denominator > c·k²
  sorry

/-- For medium-J non-crisis, n₁ is bounded by a constant (the key issue!) -/
theorem n1_bounded_medium_j (k : ℕ) (cycle : BinaryCycle k)
    (hk : k > 100)
    (h_medium : ⌊1.585 * k⌋ < sumJ k cycle.jSeq ∧ 
                sumJ k cycle.jSeq < 2 * k - k / 10)
    (h_not_crisis : ¬isCrisis k) :
    ∃ M : ℝ, M > 0 ∧ (cycle.elements 0 : ℝ) ≤ M := by
  -- With C ~ 3^k and denominator ~ δ·3^k
  -- We get n₁ ~ constant, which doesn't grow with k
  -- This is why the original proof approach fails!
  sorry

/-! ## Growth Comparisons -/

/-- 3^k eventually dominates k² · 2^k -/
theorem exp_3_dominates (ε : ℝ) (hε : ε > 0) :
    ∃ K, ∀ k > K, 3^k > ε * k^2 * 2^k := by
  -- Since (3/2)^k → ∞ faster than any polynomial
  sorry

/-- But 3^k does NOT dominate 2^k by more than polynomial factors -/
theorem exp_3_vs_2_bound :
    ∃ c > 0, ∀ k, 3^k ≤ c * k^10 * 2^k := by
  -- This is why medium-J analysis is difficult
  sorry
