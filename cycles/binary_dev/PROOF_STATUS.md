# Binary Collatz Proof Status

## Summary

The proof of binary Collatz cycle impossibility is **incomplete** due to a fundamental error in a key bound. However, significant portions remain valid and the overall approach may be salvageable with corrections.

**UPDATE (2025-06-17)**: The incorrect C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k bound has been removed from the codebase and replaced with the correct understanding that C grows like 3^k, not 4^k. The growth analysis has been updated accordingly.

## The Critical Error

### What Was Claimed
- **Bound**: C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k for all cycle-compatible j-sequences
- **Source**: Used throughout the crisis and medium-J analysis
- **Impact**: Central to proving contradictions in these cases

### What Is Actually True
- For all j=1 sequences: C ≈ 2 × 3^k (not related to 4^k)
- For cycle-compatible sequences (J ≥ ⌊1.585k⌋): C/4^k **decreases** with k
- The bound C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k is **false** for k ≥ 8

### Computational Evidence
```
k=5:  C/4^k ≈ 0.84 ✓ (bound holds)
k=7:  C/4^k ≈ 0.91 ✓ (bound holds)  
k=8:  C/4^k ≈ 0.52 ✗ (bound fails)
k=10: C/4^k ≈ 0.30 ✗ (bound fails badly)
k=20: C/4^k ≈ 0.06 ✗ (decreasing with k)
```

## What Remains Valid

### 1. High-J Case (≥90% j=2 positions)
- **Status**: ✓ Proof is correct
- **Method**: Modular incompatibility
- **Key insight**: j=2 requires n ≡ 1 (mod 8) for odd output
- **Result**: Cascading constraints make cycles impossible

### 2. Small k (k < 100)  
- **Status**: ✓ Can be verified computationally
- **Method**: Direct enumeration and checking
- **Note**: Just needs implementation

### 3. Algebraic Framework
- **Status**: ✓ All correct
- **Includes**: 
  - Cycle equation: n₁(2^J - 3^k) = C
  - J bounds: ⌊1.585k⌋ < J ≤ 2k
  - Growth bounds: n_max/n_min ≤ 1.057^k (for specific J)

### 4. Crisis Phenomenon
- **Status**: ⚠️ Exists but needs new analysis
- **Valid part**: When {αk} < 1/k², denominator |2^J - 3^k| < 3^k/k²
- **Invalid part**: Using C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k to derive contradiction
- **Needed**: Alternative approach using correct C bounds

## What Needs Revision

### 1. Crisis Analysis
**Problem**: Current proof tries to show n_min > 2^k using incorrect C bound

**Possible fixes**:
- Use actual C bounds (related to 3^k, not 4^k)
- Focus on modular incompatibilities during crisis
- Analyze the specific form of C for crisis-compatible sequences

### 2. Medium-J Analysis  
**Problem**: Also relies on incorrect C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k bound

**Possible fixes**:
- Direct structural analysis of j-patterns
- Use the cycle sum identity with correct bounds
- Exploit the fact that C/4^k decreases with k

### 3. C Lower Bounds
**Needed**: Correct characterization of min C for cycle-compatible sequences

**What we know**:
- C depends strongly on j-pattern
- Minimum occurs when j=2 positions come first
- For cycles: need specific J range which constrains C

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option 1: Fix the Existing Approach
1. Derive correct lower bounds for C based on J constraints
2. Rework crisis contradiction using these bounds
3. Complete medium-J analysis with structural arguments

### Option 2: New Approach
1. Focus on the decreasing nature of C/4^k
2. Show this is incompatible with cycle requirements for large k
3. Use modular analysis more extensively

### Option 3: Computational Extension
1. Verify up to larger k (say k < 1000)
2. Use asymptotic analysis only for very large k
3. Develop tighter bounds specific to cycle-compatible sequences

## Conclusion

While the proof has a significant error, the framework and many techniques remain sound. The high-J case is completely proven, small k can be verified, and the algebraic machinery is correct. The crisis and medium-J cases need new approaches that don't rely on the incorrect C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k bound.

The path to a complete proof likely involves:
1. Understanding the true behavior of C for cycle-compatible sequences
2. Finding alternative contradictions in the crisis/medium-J cases
3. Possibly extending computational verification to larger k values
