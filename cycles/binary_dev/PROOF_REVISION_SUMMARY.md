# Binary Collatz Proof Revision Summary

## The Fundamental Error

The original proof was built on a false premise: **C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k** for all k-cycles.

### What Actually Happens
Computational evidence shows:
- For k = 3-7: The bound C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k holds
- For k ≥ 8: The bound fails dramatically
- For k = 8: C/4^k ≈ 0.52
- For k = 20: C/4^k ≈ 0.06
- The correct growth: **C ~ 3^k**, not 4^k

### Why This Matters
The entire medium-J analysis relied on showing C/4^k → 0 as k → ∞ to derive a contradiction. With C ~ 3^k:
- We still have C/4^k = (C/3^k) × (3/4)^k → 0
- But this doesn't lead to the claimed contradiction
- The cycle equation n₁ = C/|2^J - 3^k| gives n₁ ~ constant, not n₁ > 2^k

## Current Proof Status

### What Still Works
1. **Small k (k ≤ 100)**: Computationally verified - no changes needed
2. **High-J cycles**: Modular contradiction still valid - doesn't use C bounds
3. **Crisis cycles**: Still impossible - C ~ 3^k actually strengthens this case
4. **Fundamental equations**: Cycle equation, J-sum bounds remain correct

### What's Broken
1. **Medium-J non-crisis cycles**: The main gap
   - Original approach used C/4^k decay
   - Need completely new contradiction mechanism
   - This is a significant portion of cases

2. **Several "proven" theorems**: Actually rely on the false bound
   - C_ratio_decreasing
   - Various medium-J impossibility results
   - Some element distribution theorems

## Files Changed

### Core Framework
- **ProofAxioms.lean**: Removed false C/4^k decay axiom
- **CRatioDecreasingProof.lean**: Marked as obsolete with explanation
- **MediumJComplete.lean**: Added clear TODOs and sorry statements

### Documentation
- **PROOF_COMPLETE_BINARY_CYCLES.md**: Corrected the key insight
- **verify_key_results.py**: Shows actual C growth pattern
- **verify_extended.py**: Removed invalid checks

## What's Needed

1. **New approach for medium-J cycles**: 
   - Perhaps structural constraints from j-patterns
   - Element growth/shrinkage balance
   - Different modular analysis

2. **Honest assessment**: 
   - The proof is incomplete
   - The gap is substantial
   - New mathematical insights needed
