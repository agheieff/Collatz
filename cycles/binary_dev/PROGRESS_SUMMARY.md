# Binary Collatz Proof Progress Summary

## Systematic Reassessment Complete

### 1. Current State Analysis
- **170 sorry statements** across 31 Lean files (not 85-90% complete as claimed)
- Critical mathematical error fixed: C grows like 3^k, not 4^k
- Fundamental cycle equation is actually proven (in CycleEquationClean.lean)
- Main theorem structure is sound but relies on incomplete components

### 2. Completed Actions
✓ Cataloged all 170 sorry statements into 8 categories
✓ Classified axioms: identified which are computational vs theoretical
✓ Removed redundant cycle_equation_axiom (proof already exists)
✓ Updated imports to use actual proof instead of axiom
✓ Created framework for C growth proof (CGrowthProof.lean)

### 3. Critical Issues Identified

#### Mathematical Gaps
1. **C Growth Analysis** (CRITICAL)
   - Old claim: C ≥ 0.686 × 4^k (FALSE for k ≥ 8)
   - Truth: C ~ 3^k with C/4^k decreasing exponentially
   - Impact: Medium-J and crisis proofs need updating

2. **Coverage Gaps**
   - High-J: Only proven for k > 1000, needs extension to k > 100
   - Crisis: Incomplete for 100 < k ≤ 1000
   - Small k: Relies on unverified computational axiom

3. **Proof Dependencies**
   - Many "sorry" statements in critical paths
   - Over-reliance on axioms for provable results
   - Circular reasoning risks from poor organization

### 4. File Organization Issues
- Multiple versions of similar theorems (3 FinalTheorem variants)
- 31+ Lean files with unclear relationships
- Scattered Python scripts without clear purpose
- Documentation inconsistencies

### 5. Next Steps Priority

#### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete C growth proof showing C ~ 3^k
2. Prove C/4^k decay for cycle-compatible sequences
3. Update all dependent proofs with correct bounds

#### Phase 2: Coverage Extension (1 week)
1. Generalize high-J proof to k > 100
2. Complete crisis analysis for all k
3. Implement computational verification for k ≤ 100

#### Phase 3: Technical Cleanup (3-4 days)
1. Fill routine mathematical gaps
2. Remove duplicate files
3. Create clean import structure

### 6. Realistic Timeline
- **Not 6-9 days or 3 weeks as claimed**
- **Realistic estimate: 3-4 weeks of focused effort**
- Main bottleneck: Correcting proofs to use C ~ 3^k bound

### 7. Key Insight
The proof strategy remains sound, but the mathematical details need significant work. The claim of being "85-90% complete" appears to count file creation rather than actual proof completion. With 170 sorry statements remaining, the true completion is closer to 60-70%.
